In Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) we have basically 3 main files :

1. Feature files
2. Steps Definitions files
3. Test Runner class 

Feature Files: These are written in the Gherkin language and contain scenarios that describe the behavior of the system from the user's perspective.

Steps Definitions: These are the actual code implementations of the steps outlined in the feature files. They define the actions that need to be taken to fulfill the scenarios.

Test Runner class - From Test Runner class we can run feature file ,add tags, reporting plugin etc
